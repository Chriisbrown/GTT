Latency total:
From first track to Internal Track (LinksIn->InTTTrack): 3
From InTTTrack to Transformed TTTrack:  6 
From TTTrack to Internal Vertex: 1
From Initial Internal Vertex to Vertex Into TTTrackSaver: 100 Clocks
From Final TTTrack to vertex out: 28 Clock Cycles

From vertex to Track association 5 clocks
From vertex to read out track 3 clocks
From first read out track to Track association 2 clock cycles
From track association to track selection 2 cycles
From track selection to MET 1 cycle
Sector MET MAC for as many cycles as there are tracks -> depends on number of tracks in each stream
Global MET AC for as many cycles as there are streams but depends on their Sector MET MAC latency

Global AC reset to MET out: 11 clocks
Global MET out to link: 1 clock

From first track to Vertex Out: 136 Clock Cycles
From first track recieved to MET out: 171 Clock Cycles

From final track to received MET 62 cycles varies
From final track to Vertex 28 cycles no variation
From vertex to MET 33 cycles varies
